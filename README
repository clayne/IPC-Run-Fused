IPC::Run::Fused

Have you ever tried to do essentially the same as you would in bash do
to this:

  parentapp <( app 2>&1  )

And found massive road works getting in the way.

Sure, you can always do this style syntax:

  open my $fh, 'someapp --args foo 2>&1 |';

But that's not very nice, because

1. you're relying on a sub-shell to do that for you
2. you have to manually escape everything
3. you can't use list context.

And none of this is very Modern or Nice
